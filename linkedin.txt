Good day!
 
Thank you for your LinkedIn invitation. Could you maybe elaborate on the purpose of your invitation?

In my efforts to get to most out of LinkedIn I have chosen to only accept a LinkedIn invite if I know why. Examples of valid reasons for me to connect on LinkedIn are e.g. us having worked on a project together or us knowing each other outside of LinkedIn as well. But, I have conencted for other reasons too. So I'm not saying no, yet, I honestly want to learn more.

On the other hand, us working in the same industry or just being part of the same LinkedIn group or demography alone isn't enough for me. Also if you are trying to link with me, just because you like the content I post on LinkedIn, then the "follow" feature might be more suitable for you.

P.S.
If you are a recruiter and trying to recruit me. The answer is no. I'm extremely happy with where I am. If you are a recruiter and offering your services, you are "barking up the wrong tree", please review https://schubergphilis.com/en/faq. And, if you are just reaching out to sell me something or introduce your company/product/service to me, I’m going to decline what I’m sure was a lovely invitation. If you want all my reasons why send me a message back and I will send them all.
