Good day!
 
Thank you for your LinkedIn invitation. I must admit I'm a bit puzzled why I am receiving your invitation.

In my efforts to get to most out of LinkedIn I have chosen to go for a quality vs. quantity strategy and that means that I will only accept a LinkedIn invite if I know why. Examples of valid reasons for me to connect on LinkedIn are e.g. us having worked on a project together or us knowing each other outside of LinkedIn as well. Us working in the same industry or just being part of the same LinkedIn group or demography isn't. Also if you are trying to link with me, just because you like the content I post on LinkedIn, then the "follow" feature might be more suitable for you.

However, it could be that there is a valid reason for us to connect, and you just failed to include it in your connection request. In that case, could you send me a follow-up message?

P.S. 1
If you are a recruiter and trying to recruit me. The answer is no. I'm extremely happy with where I am. If you are a recruiter and offering you services, you are "barking up the wrong tree", please review https://schubergphilis.com/en/faq

P.S. 2
If you are reaching out to sell me something or introduce your company/product/service to me, I’m going to decline what I’m sure was a lovely invitation. If you want all my reasons why send me a message back and I will send them all.

P.S. 3
There is no need to reach out again or remind me about this message unless we have a new valid reason to connect. In fact, be aware that I never suggest a recruiter/vendor to call/email back at a set time, so if you start with, "Frank, I’m following back up as you suggested…” note that I’ll stop reading there.
