Good day!
 
Thank you for your LinkedIn invitation. Could you maybe elaborate on the purpose of your invitation?

In my efforts to get to most out of LinkedIn I have chosen to only accept a LinkedIn invite if I know why. Examples of valid reasons for me to connect on LinkedIn are e.g. us having worked on a project together or us knowing each other outside of LinkedIn as well. But, I have conencted for other reasons too. So I'm not saying no, yet, I honestly want to learn more.

P.S.
If you are a recruiter and trying to recruit me. The answer is no. I'm extremely happy with where I am. If you are a recruiter and offering your services, you are "barking up the wrong tree", please review hxxps://schubergphilis.com/en/faq.
